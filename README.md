# Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Refactor Code to meet Accessibility Standards
 This week's Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means we begin with starter code that we need to modify. The Module 1 Challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility 

# User Story
AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* * THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* * THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* * THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes 
* * THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* * THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Lillian's Recap 
I refactored the Horiseon landing page to meet accessibility standards by utilizing semantic HTML elements, revising heading attributes to be sequential and logical, inserting alt text for images, and updating the page title to be descriptive and succinct.
